#I need some help getting started programming

The good news is, openFrameworks is supported by a broad and inclusive group of people 
from across the globe. All of whom are more than happy to help with any issues you may find as you develop your skills and knowledge of oF (as those in the know call it!).

What you won’t necessarily get on the forums or mailing list, are the basic steps to understanding C++ programming and how openFrameworks is a part of that.

To help you get started, and open up the world of openFrameworks for you, we’ve compiled a list of resources. Books, websites and other ephemera that will get you on your way.

Like the rest of the programming community, openFrameworks is always welcome to receive new people who challenge and expand the available libraries, fine tune the core code and just generally show what amazing stuff you’ve learnt to do. Join us, open a new world today.
