#What is openFrameworks?

##Introduction

openFrameworks (also regularly referred to as <code>OF</code>) is an open source C++ toolkit for creative coding.

###Is it a program?

OF is not itself a program or an application but you can use OF to write your own programs and applications.

###Is it a programming language?

OF isnâ€™t a programming language in itself. The  language you use to write programs with OF is C++. OF is a software framework (see below) that uses C++ to program and make use of all the classes, methods addons that you will have available to you.

###So it's a library?

OF is in fact made up of several software libraries but the specific way it integrates these libraries together is more appropriately called a software framework.

###What is a software framework?

A software framework is a kind of pre-fabricated software infrastructure designed to provide all of the low level functionality needed for an application while allowing a programmer to customize the higher level details of what that application should do.

One way that using a framework differs from using a library is that the flow of control is inverted. A library can be directly controlled by your code to perform a set of general tasks. In a framework your code responds to events controlled by the framework and uses the framework as an interface to access the functionality of other libraries. Sound complicated? In fact many other multimedia authoring environments work this way even if they do so less transparently.

Consider this loose analogy: You are writing and directing your own film and have decided to work with a film production company. The production company reserves the location, provides all of the infrastructure, finds the camera crew, lighting director, sound engineer and other important staff. It makes sure everyone is on the set on time and doing their job when they should, including you. Your job is to define what happens on the set once everyone is ready. OpenFrameworks is like a film production company for your program. It takes care of the administrative and logistical details and allows you to concentrate on your creative vision.
